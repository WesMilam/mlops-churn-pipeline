# End-to-End MLOps Pipeline with CI/CD | @DrWesMilam

**Production-ready ML pipeline using FastAPI, MLFlow, Docker, and GitHub Actions for full model lifecycle management.**

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning operations (MLOps) workflow for a customer churn prediction use case. It walks through every step of the ML lifecycle including:

- 📊 Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- 🤖 Model training using Scikit-learn
- 🧪 Experiment tracking with MLFlow
- 🚀 API serving using FastAPI
- 📦 Containerization with Docker
- 🔁 Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) via GitHub Actions
- ☁️ Deployment to AWS EC2 and S3 for model and API hosting

The objective is to provide a clean, reproducible, and production-aligned MLOps project showcasing current industry practices.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, MLFlow
- FastAPI for REST API
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- AWS EC2 + S3 for deployment
